 OpenShift secrets allow you to load private data into your pods and containers without baking them into your container images for all to see and use. This allows you to separate your prave data from your code, and securely host your images in public registries. In this example, we'll be using OpenShift secrets to store a set of API key credentials for an AWS (Amazon Web Services) IAM (Identity and Access Management) account, which we'll be using to send emails with Amazon SES (Simple Email Service).
