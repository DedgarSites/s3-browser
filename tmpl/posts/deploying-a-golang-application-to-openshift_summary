OpenShift uses Kubernetes orchestration to manage a variety of container runtimes inside pods, and run them in a public or dedicated cloud environment. It includes support for Docker containers, which we'll be using in this example. Applications can be made HA (High Availability) by running multiple instances of your application in parallel connected by an OpenShift service, and can scale up or down appropriately in response to changing traffic loads. In this case, our container will be running independently, but applications can be integrated with other services, persistent storage such as databases, which I will be covering in a future post.
